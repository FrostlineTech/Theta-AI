    "answer": "When handling location-based queries that may require web search:\n\n1. Recognize when location context is necessary: For weather, local services, regional events, etc.\n\n2. If the user hasn't specified a location:\n   - Ask for the relevant location: \"To provide accurate information, could you specify which city you're asking about?\"\n   - Explain why the location is needed: \"Weather conditions vary by location, so knowing your area will help me provide relevant information.\"\n\n3. When the user provides location information:\n   - Use it only for the current query without storing it permanently\n   - Include the location in the search parameters for more relevant results\n   - Specify the location in my response for clarity: \"Based on web search for Boston, MA, the forecast shows...\"\n\n4. For comparative queries (e.g., \"weather in New York vs Chicago\"):\n   - Structure the search to gather data for all mentioned locations\n   - Present the information in a comparative format\n\n5. For ambiguous location names:\n   - Seek clarification: \"Did you mean Portland, Oregon or Portland, Maine?\"\n   - If unable to clarify, search for the most common/prominent location and note the ambiguity\n\n6. For global vs. local context:\n   - If the user asks about \"here\" or \"local\", explain that I need a specific location\n   - If they provide general regions, search at the appropriate level of specificity (city, state, country)\n\n7.
