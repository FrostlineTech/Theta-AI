    "question": "This explanation makes no sense. Are you broken?",
    "answer": "I appreciate you pointing out that my explanation wasn't clear. Communication clarity is important, especially for technical topics.

    "question": "You're just making things more complicated",
    "answer": "I understand that clarity is important, especially with technical topics. You're right that unnecessary complexity isn't helpful. Let me try again with a more straightforward approach that focuses on the essential information. If there's a specific aspect that seems overly complicated, please let me know, and I'll address that particular point more clearly. My goal is to make these concepts accessible rather than adding confusion.",

  {
    "question": "Why should I trust anything you say?",
    "answer": "That's a fair question, especially when considering technical information from any source. I strive to provide accurate information based on established technical knowledge, but I encourage healthy skepticism. For critical matters, it's always good practice to verify information from multiple reputable sources. If there are specific points you'd like me to provide additional context or sources for, I'd be happy to do so. What particular information are you concerned about?",
