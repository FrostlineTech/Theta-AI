    "question": "What is the difference between 'affect' and 'effect'?",
    "answer": "• 'Affect' is typically used as a verb meaning to influence or produce a change in something. Example: 'The weather affects my mood.'\n• 'Effect' is most commonly used as a noun meaning the result or outcome of a cause. Example: 'The effect of the medication was immediate.'\n\nHowever, there are less common usages:\n• 'Effect' can be used as a verb meaning to bring about or cause something to happen. Example: 'The new manager effected many positive changes.'\n• 'Affect' can be used as a noun in psychology to refer to emotional display.

    "question": "How do I properly use semicolons?",
    "answer": "Semicolons (;) serve several specific purposes in English writing:\n\n1. Connecting closely related independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction:\n   • Incorrect: 'I enjoy reading; and I write in my journal daily.'\n   • Correct: 'I enjoy reading; I write in my journal daily.'\n\n2. Separating items in a complex list where the items themselves contain commas:\n   • 'The conference had attendees from Paris, France; London, England; and Rome, Italy.'\n\n3. Before conjunctive adverbs or transitional phrases that connect independent clauses:\n   • 'The research was conclusive; however, more studies are still needed.'\n   • 'She didn't study; consequently, she failed the exam.'\n\nRemember that both sides of a semicolon must be able to stand alone as complete sentences. If one side is a dependent clause, use a comma or other punctuation instead.",

    "question": "What are the rules for using 'who' versus 'whom'?",
    "answer": "The distinction between 'who' and 'whom' relates to their grammatical function in a sentence:\n\n• 'Who' is used as the subject of a verb (performing the action). It functions like 'he', 'she', or 'they'.\n  Example: 'Who sent this email?' (Here, 'who' is performing the action of sending)\n\n• 'Whom' is used as the object of a verb or preposition (receiving the action). It functions like 'him', 'her', or 'them'.\n  Example: 'To whom should I address this letter?' (Here, 'whom' is receiving the action)\n\nA simple test: Try substituting 'he/she/they' or 'him/her/them' in your sentence:\n• If 'he/she/they' works, use 'who'\n• If 'him/her/them' works, use 'whom'\n\nFor example:\n• 'Who/He called you?' (Correct: Who)\n• 'You called whom/him?' (Correct: Whom)\n\nIn modern casual English, 'who' is often used in place of 'whom', but formal writing still observes this distinction.",

    "question": "How do I use apostrophes correctly for possession and contractions?",
    "answer": "Apostrophes have two main uses in English: to show possession and to form contractions.\n\nFor possessives:\n1. For singular nouns, add 's: 'The dog's bowl' (bowl belonging to one dog)\n2. For plural nouns ending in s, add just the apostrophe: 'The dogs' bowls' (bowls belonging to multiple dogs)\n3. For plural nouns not ending in s, add 's: 'The children's toys' (toys belonging to the children)\n4. For singular proper names ending in s, style guides differ:\n   • Traditional: Add 's: 'James's book'\n   • Some styles: Just add an apostrophe: 'James' book'\n5. For joint possession, add the apostrophe to the last name only: 'Jack and Jill's pail'\n6. For separate possession, add to both: 'Jack's and Jill's opinions differ'\n\nFor contractions (combining words):\n1. Replace omitted letters with an apostrophe: \n   • 'do not' → 'don't'\n   • 'they are' → 'they're'\n   • 'it is' → 'it's'\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\n• Don't use apostrophes for plural forms: 'apples' not 'apple's'\n• Distinguish between its (possessive) and it's (contraction of 'it is')\n• Similarly, distinguish between your/you're, their/they're/there",

    "question": "What are the rules for subject-verb agreement?",
    "answer": "Subject-verb agreement means the subject and verb must match in number (singular or plural). Here are the key rules:\n\n1. Singular subjects take singular verbs:\n   • 'The dog barks.' (Not 'The dog bark.')\n   • 'She writes poetry.' (Not 'She write poetry.')\n\n2. Plural subjects take plural verbs:\n   • 'The dogs bark.' (Not 'The dogs barks.')\n   • 'They write poetry.' (Not 'They writes poetry.')\n\n3. Compound subjects joined by 'and' typically take plural verbs:\n   • 'Jack and Jill are climbing the hill.'\n\n4. When subjects are joined by 'or' or 'nor', the verb agrees with the subject closest to it:\n   • 'Either the teacher or the students are responsible.' (Plural 'students' is closest)\n   • 'Either the students or the teacher is responsible.' (Singular 'teacher' is closest)\n\n5. Collective nouns can be singular or plural depending on whether the group acts as a unit or as individuals:\n   • 'The team is winning the championship.' (Acting as a unit)\n   • 'The team are arguing among themselves.' (Acting as individuals)\n\n6. Don't be misled by phrases between the subject and verb:\n   • 'The box of chocolates is on the table.' ('Box' is the subject, not 'chocolates')\n\n7. Indefinite pronouns like 'everyone,' 'someone,' 'nobody,' and 'each' take singular verbs:\n   • 'Everyone has arrived.' (Not 'Everyone have arrived.')",

    "question": "What are the different types of conditional sentences and how do I form them correctly?",
    "answer": "Conditional sentences express hypothetical situations and their consequences. There are four main types in English:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for general truths or scientific facts\n   • Form: If + present simple, present simple\n   • Example: 'If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.'\n   • Meaning: This always happens in these conditions.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for likely or possible future situations\n   • Form: If + present simple, will + base verb\n   • Example: 'If it rains tomorrow, we'll cancel the picnic.'\n   • Meaning: This might happen in the future.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for unlikely, hypothetical, or impossible present situations\n   • Form: If + past simple, would + base verb\n   • Example: 'If I won the lottery, I would travel the world.'\n   • Meaning: This is unlikely or counterfactual in the present.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for hypothetical situations in the past (that didn't happen)\n   • Form: If + past perfect, would have + past participle\n   • Example: 'If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.'\n   • Meaning: This didn't happen in the past, but we're imagining a different outcome.\n\nMixed conditionals combine elements of different types, usually connecting a past condition to a present result:\n• 'If I had saved money when I was younger (3rd), I would be wealthy now (2nd).'\n\nCommon errors include using 'will' in if-clauses ('If it will rain' is incorrect) and mixing tenses inappropriately.",

    "question": "How do I correctly use commas in my writing?",
    "answer": "Commas serve several functions in English writing:\n\n1. Separating items in a series:\n   • 'I need to buy milk, bread, and eggs.' (The final comma before 'and' is the optional Oxford comma)\n\n2. Joining independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so):\n   • 'She studied all night, but she still failed the test.'\n\n3. Setting off introductory elements:\n   • 'After the movie, we went for dinner.'\n   • 'Well, I never expected to see you here.'\n\n4. Separating non-essential information (could be removed without changing the sentence's core meaning):\n   • 'My brother, who lives in Paris, is visiting next week.' (Non-essential)\n   • 'The woman who lives next door is a doctor.' (Essential, no commas)\n\n5. Separating coordinate adjectives (adjectives that can be rearranged and separated by 'and'):\n   • 'It was a long, tiring journey.' (Could be 'tiring, long' or 'long and tiring')\n   • 'She wore a beautiful red dress.' (Not 'red beautiful' or 'beautiful and red', so no comma)\n\n6. With geographical names, dates, and addresses:\n   • 'She was born in Paris, France, on April 15, 1990.'\n   • 'Send the letter to 123 Main Street, Anytown, CA 90210.'\n\n7. Setting off direct quotations:\n   • 'She said, \"I'll be there soon.\"'\n\nCommon comma errors:\n• Comma splices (joining independent clauses without a conjunction)\n• Missing commas with non-essential elements\n• Unnecessary commas between subjects and verbs or verbs and objects",

    "question": "What's the difference between active and passive voice, and when should each be used?",
    "answer": "Active and passive voice differ in how they structure the relationship between the action, the performer, and the recipient:\n\n• Active voice: The subject performs the action.\n  Structure: Subject → Verb → Object\n  Example: 'The chef prepared the meal.'\n\n• Passive voice: The subject receives the action.\n  Structure: Subject ← Verb ← (by Object)\n  Example: 'The meal was prepared by the chef.' or 'The meal was prepared.'\n\nCharacteristics of passive voice:\n• Uses a form of 'to be' (is, are, was, were) plus past participle\n• The doer of the action may be omitted entirely\n• Often wordier than active voice\n\nWhen to use active voice (generally preferred):\n1. For clarity and directness in most writing\n2. When the doer of the action is important\n3. To create stronger, more concise sentences\n4. In narrative writing and most business communication\n\nWhen passive voice is appropriate:\n1. When the recipient of the action is more important than the doer\n   • 'The bank was robbed yesterday.' (The bank is the focus)\n2. When the doer is unknown, unimportant, or obvious\n   • 'Mistakes were made.' (Unknown/avoiding responsibility)\n   • 'This building was constructed in 1930.' (Builder unimportant)\n3. In scientific writing to emphasize objectivity\n   • 'The samples were tested under controlled conditions.'\n4. To be diplomatic or avoid accusation\n   • 'Your payment has not been received.' (vs. 'You haven't paid.')\n\nGood writing typically uses both voices appropriately, with active voice predominating.",
