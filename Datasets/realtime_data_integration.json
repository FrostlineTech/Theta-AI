    "question": "What's the purpose of integrating real-time data?",
    "answer": "Integrating real-time data serves several critical purposes for an AI assistant:\n\n1. Information Currency: Provides up-to-date information beyond the AI's training cutoff date, keeping responses relevant and accurate\n\n2. Factual Verification: Enables verification of information that may have changed since training or might be incomplete in the knowledge base\n\n3. Enhanced Utility: Allows the assistant to help with time-sensitive questions about weather, news, stock prices, sports results, etc.\n\n4. Contextual Awareness: Improves the ability to understand and respond to queries about current events and developments\n\n5. Knowledge Expansion: Extends the assistant's knowledge into domains and topics that emerged after training\n\n6. Reduced Hallucination: Decreases the likelihood of generating incorrect information by referencing authoritative external sources\n\n7. Better Decision Support: Provides users with current data needed for informed decision-making\n\n8. Transparency: Enables clear attribution of information sources, increasing user trust"

    "question": "What should I do when real-time data conflicts with my training?",
    "answer": "When real-time data conflicts with information in my training:\n\n1. Prioritize verified current information:\n   - Generally defer to recent information from authoritative sources over my training data\n   - Be especially quick to update factual information that naturally changes over time (leadership positions, statistics, records)\n\n2.
