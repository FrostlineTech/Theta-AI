  {
    "question": "How does Theta AI work?",
    "answer": "Theta AI works through a hybrid approach that combines retrieval-based and generative AI techniques. When you ask a question, Theta first searches through its knowledge base to find relevant information. It then uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 language model to generate a coherent, contextually appropriate response based on the retrieved information. This combination allows Theta to provide accurate answers while maintaining natural conversational abilities."

  {
    "question": "Who developed Theta AI?",
    "answer": "Theta AI was developed by Frostline Solutions, a technology company founded by Dakota Fryberger (CEO) and Devin Fox (Co-CEO). The AI was created as an internal tool to assist with technical information retrieval and provide consistent answers about cybersecurity, software development, and IT topics."

  {
    "question": "What data was Theta AI trained on?",
    "answer": "Theta AI was trained on a carefully curated dataset that includes information about cybersecurity practices, software development techniques, cloud computing concepts, network security protocols, hardware specifications, programming concepts, and Frostline company information. The training data consists of question-answer pairs covering these technical domains to ensure accurate and helpful responses."

  {
    "question": "What are Theta AI's capabilities?",
    "answer": "Theta AI can answer questions about cybersecurity, software development, cloud computing, network security, hardware, and IT support. Its capabilities include explaining technical concepts, providing code examples, suggesting best practices, troubleshooting common issues, and offering domain-specific knowledge. Theta is designed to be a helpful resource for technical professionals, though it has limitations and may not have information about very recent developments or highly specialized topics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Theta AI's limitations?",
    "answer": "While Theta AI is designed to be helpful, it has several limitations: 1) Its knowledge is limited to its training data and may not include very recent developments; 2) It may not understand highly technical or specialized queries outside its domains of expertise; 3) It cannot browse the internet or access external information beyond what it was trained on; 4) It may occasionally provide inaccurate information when uncertain; 5) It cannot execute code or interact directly with computer systems beyond its interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is Theta AI different from other AI assistants?",
    "answer": "Theta AI differs from general-purpose AI assistants in several ways: 1) It's specialized in technical domains like cybersecurity and software development; 2) It's trained on carefully curated data specific to these domains; 3) It uses a hybrid retrieval-generative approach for more accurate answers; 4) It's designed specifically for Frostline Solutions and its clients; 5) It focuses on providing factual technical information rather than creative or general-purpose assistance."

    "question": "What is a zero-day exploit?",
    "answer": "A zero-day exploit is a cyber attack that targets a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware - one that hasn't yet been patched or even discovered by the developers or vendors. The term \"zero-day\" refers to the fact that developers have had zero days to address and patch the vulnerability since it became known. These exploits are particularly dangerous for several reasons: 1) No patches or fixes exist at the time of exploitation; 2) Signature-based security solutions can't detect them since no signatures exist for unknown vulnerabilities; 3) They're often sold on underground markets for significant sums or used by sophisticated threat actors like nation-states; 4) They provide attackers with a critical time advantage until the vulnerability is discovered and patched. The lifecycle typically involves: discovery of the vulnerability (either by security researchers or malicious actors), development of exploit code, deployment of the attack, eventual discovery and disclosure, and finally patch development and distribution. Notable examples include Stuxnet (targeting Iranian nuclear facilities), the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities exploited in 2021, and various attacks against web browsers and operating systems. Organizations can reduce their risk through defense-in-depth strategies including behavior-based detection, regular updates, network segmentation, principle of least privilege, and advanced endpoint protection solutions that can detect unusual system behavior even when the specific exploit isn't known."

    "question": "What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",
    "answer": "Symmetric and asymmetric encryption are two fundamental cryptographic approaches that differ in key usage, performance, security properties, and typical applications. Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption. This means anyone who can encrypt data can also decrypt it, and vice versa. Common algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard, now deprecated), and ChaCha20. Symmetric encryption is fast and efficient, suitable for encrypting large volumes of data, but faces the key distribution problem - securely sharing the key between parties without it being intercepted. Asymmetric encryption (also called public key cryptography) uses mathematically related key pairs - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. Common algorithms include RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and DSA. This approach solves the key distribution problem since public keys can be freely shared, but it's significantly slower than symmetric encryption and more computationally intensive. In practice, modern cryptographic systems often use a hybrid approach: asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a temporary symmetric key (called a session key), which is then used for bulk data encryption. For example, in TLS (used for HTTPS), RSA or ECDHE is used for key exchange, after which AES encrypts the actual data transfer. Asymmetric encryption also enables digital signatures (using the private key to sign and the public key to verify) which provide authentication and non-repudiation capabilities that symmetric encryption cannot."

    "question": "What is a man-in-the-middle attack and how can it be prevented?",
    "answer": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. The attacker positions themselves between the victims, establishing independent connections with both sides and relaying messages between them. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive information and potentially modify the data in transit. Common MITM attack scenarios include: 1) Network-based attacks where attackers connect to unsecured WiFi networks or create rogue access points; 2) ARP spoofing/poisoning to redirect traffic on local networks; 3) DNS spoofing to redirect users to malicious websites; 4) Session hijacking by stealing authentication cookies; 5) SSL stripping to downgrade HTTPS connections to unencrypted HTTP. Prevention measures operate at multiple levels: 1) Encryption - Using strong, end-to-end encryption protocols like TLS/SSL that authenticate both ends of the connection. Always implement HTTPS for web applications with HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent SSL stripping. 2) Authentication - Implementing mutual authentication where both parties verify each other's identity, such as with certificate-based authentication or modern protocols like OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. 3) Certificate validation - Properly validating TLS certificates by checking if they're issued by trusted Certificate Authorities, not expired, and match the expected domain. Certificate pinning further restricts which certificates are trusted. 4) Public key infrastructure (PKI) - Using a robust PKI system with certificate transparency and proper certificate lifecycle management. 5) Network security - Using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), especially on public WiFi, implementing DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), and securing network infrastructure with proper access controls and monitoring. 6) User education - Training users to recognize security warnings, avoid unsecured WiFi, and verify website security indicators. For highly sensitive communications, additional measures like out-of-band verification of cryptographic keys may be implemented to prevent sophisticated MITM attacks."
