The expression is the output for each item, the iterable is what you're looping through, and the condition (optional) filters items. Would you like an example?"

If you want only even numbers: [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] would give [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]. Does that help clarify how they work?"

      "content": "A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is when multiple compromised systems flood a target with traffic, overwhelming it and making it unavailable to legitimate users. Unlike a regular DoS attack that uses a single system, DDoS attacks use multiple sources, making them harder to stop. They're often launched from botnets - networks of infected computers controlled remotely without their owners' knowledge."

SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers software applications over the internet that are managed by the provider - you just use the software. Would you like examples of each?"

Try these solutions: 1) Move your router to a more central location if possible, 2) Consider a Wi-Fi extender or mesh network system, 3) Make sure your router's antennas are positioned vertically, 4) Update your router's firmware to the latest version, 5) Try changing the Wi-Fi channel in your router settings to avoid interference. Would you like instructions for checking and changing your router's channel?"

I recommend starting with free resources like freeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, and The Odin Project before considering paid courses or bootcamps."
