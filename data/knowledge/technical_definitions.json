    "firewall": "A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It establishes a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks.",
    "encryption": "The process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It uses mathematical algorithms to transform readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext).",
    "vulnerability": "A weakness or flaw in a system's design, implementation, or operation that could be exploited to compromise the system's security objectives.",
    "penetration testing": "A simulated cyber attack against a computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It involves active analysis of the system for potential weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors.",
    "zero-day exploit": "An attack that targets a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware, meaning the developers have had zero days to address and patch the vulnerability.",
    "ransomware": "A type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data until a sum of money (ransom) is paid. It typically encrypts files on the victim's system."
